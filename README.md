#### VENDO.MTR was created for trade professionals to rate and recommend each other; ideally, the ultimate purpose and functionality of the app will be to rate professionals and their services (RE Yelp). This is a decoupled PERN stack application with JWT token-based authentication. Users can create, rate (edit), and delete an account.
